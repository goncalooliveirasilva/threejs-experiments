# threejs-experiments

This is my playground for learning and experimenting with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).  
Here you'll find small, focused demos where I explore 3D rendering, materials, geometries, shaders, and other WebGL concepts.

Each folder is a standalone idea, not a full app.  
I'm building this to share my progress and what I learn along the way.
